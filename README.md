### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Maxime LUCET.
I am a student within the Master's program Analysis and Policy in Economics (APE) at the Paris School of Economics. 
I previously graduated from a Bachelor's Degree in Applied Economics at UniversitÃ© Paris-Dauphine-PSL. 
During this Bachelor's program, I have discovered programmation through various courses in python or R and completely fell in love with those tools. 

:computer: :chart_with_upwards_trend: As of 2022, I've had the opportunity to do two internships in research (at LEDa (2021) and EconomiX (2022)) during which I had the opportunity to extensively use programming tools.

ðŸ‘€ I am a very curious person, passionate about econom(etr)ics, computer science, mathematics and (astro)physics. 

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently interested in exploring the applications of computer science in economics and thus to see how these tools could be (cleverly) used in this field. I am therefore interested in the applications of machine (and deep) learning in econom(etr)ics, but also in agent-based models for instance.
